We have used the wiki-Vote dataset available from the SNAP repository which contains Wikipedia voting data till January 2008.
The dataset contains 7115 nodes and 103689 edges which verifies the graph that we created since we got the same results.

We intrepreted the following results from the output of the given queries 

1. The top 5 nodes with the highest outdegree shown by the outdegree results are the top 5 users who vote more than others.

2. The top 5 nodes with the highest indegree shown by the indegree results are the top 5 users who got most number of votes.

3. The page rank of top 5 nodes having the highest page rank of all shows the most important users based on the outdegree and indegree values.

4. The output of the connected component algorithm shows the top 5 users who have the largest connected component membership.

5. The triangle algorithm finds out the number of triangles passing through each node in the graph and the top 5 nodes with more number of triangles are displayed showing the nodes with maximum connectivity
